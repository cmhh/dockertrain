## A Collection of Notebooks as Learning Aids

The notebooks here are intended to be used as self-learning aids.  Some are intended to run in the context of the provided [Docker container / Dockerfile](), and some will run anywhere the appropriate kernel is available.  The general layout is:

* [`python`](python) - general Python notebooks
* [`R`](R) - general R notebooks
* [`scala`](scala) - general Scala notebooks
* [`spark`](spark) - general Apache Spark notebooks, organised by API:
    - [`python`](spark/python)
    - [`R`](spark/R)
    - [`scala`](spark/scala)

Notebooks in the [scala-tour](scala/scala-tour) folder are taken directly from [the almond.sh github repository](https://github.com/almond-sh/examples/tree/master/notebooks/scala-tour), which is itself a faithful port of the lessons found at [Tour of Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) to Jupyter notebooks.  Notebooks in the [visualization](scala/visualization) folder are modified versions of notebooks found in the [almond.sh github repository](https://github.com/almond-sh/examples/tree/master/notebooks/visualization), themselves borrowed from other websites.
