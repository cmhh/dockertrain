    "\n",
    "Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. A successful match can also deconstruct a value into its constituent parts. It is a more powerful version of the `switch` statement in Java and it can likewise be used in place of a series of if/else statements.\n",

    "## Syntax\n",
    "A match expression has a value, the `match` keyword, and at least one `case` clause."
